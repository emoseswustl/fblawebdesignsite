# fblawebdesignsite

This website was created for the FBLA Website Design competitive event by Ethan Moses. It is an entirely static site, and adapts well to screens and devices of all kinds. Its grid system is percentage-based, but all elements take up the full width of the page below the breakpoint of 1100px. Its bold colors and rounded design is partially inspired by Google's Material You.

This website is deployed with Netlify.

Two other code libraries were used: Normalize.css to improve browser compatability, and a pure CSS pop-out menu by Erik Terwan. These were not integral to the functioning or content of the website. Other icons and images are detailed in credits.html.

It fully describes a new business, Caldera, that is focused on providing technology services to the surrounding community.
