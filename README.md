# fblawebdesignsite

This website was created for the FBLA Website Design competitive event by Ethan Moses. It is an entirely static site, adapting well to screens and devices of all kinds. Its grid system is percentage-based, but all elements take up the full width of the page below the breakpoint of 1100px. Its bold colors and rounded design is partially inspired by Google's Material You. A clear contrast shows users which information is more important, guiding them through all the services that Caldera offers.

This website is deployed with Netlify.

One code library was used: a pure CSS pop-out menu by Erik Terwan for usage on mobile platforms. This library was not integral to the functioning or content of the website. Other icons, images, and resources are detailed in credits.html.

It fully describes a new business, Caldera, that is focused on providing technology services to the surrounding community.
